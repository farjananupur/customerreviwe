                        Pixel  6 Pro. Sometimes when I'm done with a video and click the replay button, the replay button and overlay remains on the video while the video plays again in the background. That's bug #1 for me. Bug #2 for me is sometimes I click on articles or links and they don't do anything, but if I close the app and open it again then navigate to the place where I saw the link and try to open it, it works fine. Pretty sure there's a third bug I've experienced as well but can't remember what it is.</p>
